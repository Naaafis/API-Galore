1. Set up the project environment
   - Install necessary dependencies such as React (latest stable version), Google Maps JavaScript API, Axios for API calls, Redux for state management, and Git for version control.
   - Set up the project structure with necessary files and folders.

2. Create a Map component
   - Use the Google Maps API to initialize a map object.
   - Set the initial coordinates and zoom level for the map. These values can be hardcoded initially and later the user can navigate to any location.
   - Add controls to adjust the zoom level and map type (satellite, terrain, etc.).

3. Create a Marker component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a marker object.
   - Set the coordinates for the marker. Users should be able to add their own markers by clicking on a location on the map.
   - Allow users to add custom labels or descriptions to the markers.

4. Create a Search component
   - Implement a search box with autocomplete functionality using the Google Maps API's Places library.
   - Save recent searches to make it easier for users to revisit previously searched locations.

5. Create a Directions component
   - Use the Google Maps API to implement a directions service.
   - Provide users with different route options (fastest, shortest, avoids tolls/highways, etc.) and the ability to print or share directions.

6. Create a Places component
   - Use the Google Maps API to implement a places service.
   - Display details like name, address, rating, and photos for places at a clicked location.
   - Allow users to filter places by type (restaurants, hotels, landmarks, etc.) or sort them by rating, distance, etc.

7. Create a StreetView component
   - Use the Google Maps API to implement a street view service.
   - Allow users to navigate within the StreetView pane using mouse or keyboard controls.

8. User Authentication Component
   - Set up a secure authentication system using a service like Firebase Authentication.

9. Geolocation Component
   - Use the Geolocation API to get the user's current location and center the map on it. Handle user permissions correctly to respect privacy.

10. Traffic Information Component
   - Use the Google Maps API to display real-time traffic information on the map, where available.

11. Public Transit Information Component
   - Use the Google Maps API to display public transit information, such as bus and train routes and schedules, where available.

12. Weather Information Component
   - Integrate with a separate weather API to display current weather information for the location that the user is viewing on the map.

13. Accessibility Features
   - Implement features like text-to-speech, high contrast mode, and keyboard navigation to make the application more accessible to users with disabilities.

14. Internationalization and Localization
   - Add features to support multiple languages and local data formats, if the application is intended for use in multiple countries.

15. Performance Optimization
   - Implement techniques to optimize the performance of the application, such as lazy loading of map data, caching of frequently accessed data, and efficient handling of API calls.

16. Security Measures
   - Implement measures to protect the application and user data from security threats, such as encryption of sensitive data, protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks, and regular security audits.

17. User Feedback Component
   - Implement a feature that allows users to provide feedback about the application.

18. Testing
   - Write both unit tests and integration tests for each component using Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process.

19. Deployment
   - Deploy the application to a cloud-based service like AWS or Google Cloud.
   - Ensure the Google Maps API key is securely stored and not exposed in the code. Use environment variables to store the API key.
   - Set up a backup and recovery strategy to protect against data loss.
