1. Set up the project environment
   - Install necessary dependencies such as React, Google Maps API, Axios for API requests, and Jest for testing.
   - Set up the project structure with necessary files and folders.

2. Create a Map component
   - Use the Google Maps API to initialize a map object.
   - Set the initial coordinates and zoom level for the map.
   - Render the map in a div container.
   - Allow the user to switch between different types of maps (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, or terrain).

3. Create a Marker component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a marker object.
   - Set the coordinates for the marker.
   - Add the marker to the map.
   - If there are multiple markers, display them all on the map.
   - When a marker is clicked, display an information window with details about the location.

4. Create a Search component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a search box.
   - Listen for user input in the search box.
   - Use the Google Maps API to search for the user's input and return the results.
   - Display the search results in a dropdown list.
   - If no results are found, display a message to the user.
   - Update the map's coordinates and zoom level based on the selected search result.

5. Create a Directions component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a directions service.
   - Listen for user input for the start and end locations.
   - Use the Google Maps API to calculate the route between the two locations.
   - If there are multiple routes, display them all and let the user choose.
   - Display the directions in a panel next to the map.

6. Create a Places component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a places service.
   - Listen for user input for the location.
   - Use the Google Maps API to search for places of interest near the location.
   - Display the places in a list next to the map.
   - When a place is clicked, display an information window with details about the place.

7. Create a StreetView component
   - Use the Google Maps API to create a street view service.
   - Listen for user input for the location.
   - Use the Google Maps API to get the street view of the location.
   - Render the street view in a div container.
   - If street view is not available for a location, display a message to the user.

8. Create a User Interface (UI)
   - Design and implement a user-friendly UI with a clean and modern look.
   - Include components for map, search, directions, places, and street view.
   - Use a responsive layout that works on different screen sizes.
   - Use a consistent color scheme throughout the application.

9. Testing
   - Write unit tests for each component using Jest.
   - Ensure all components are working as expected and there are no bugs.
   - If a test fails, debug the issue and fix it before moving on to the next task.

10. Deployment
    - Deploy the application to a server using a service like Netlify or Vercel.
    - Ensure the application works as expected in the production environment.
    - Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to handle updates to the application.
