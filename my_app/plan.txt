1. Setup the project environment
   - Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
   - Install necessary dependencies such as `react-google-maps/api` for Google Maps JavaScript API library, `axios` for API calls, and `react-router-dom` for navigation.

2. Create a Map component
   - Use the Google Maps JavaScript API to create a new map instance.
   - Set the initial coordinates and zoom level for the map.
   - Handle the API key securely by storing it in environment variables.
   - This component should be able to accept props for setting different coordinates.

3. Create a Marker component
   - Use the Google Maps JavaScript API to create a new marker instance.
   - This component should be able to accept props for setting the marker's coordinates and title.
   - Implement functionality to handle multiple markers.

4. Create a Search component
   - Implement a text input field for user to enter their search query.
   - Use the Google Maps Places library to search for places based on the user's query.
   - Display the search results to the user in a dropdown menu or a list of clickable results.

5. Create a Directions component
   - Implement two text input fields for user to enter the start and end locations.
   - Use the Google Maps Directions service to fetch directions between the two locations.
   - Handle cases where the directions service cannot find a route between the two locations by displaying an appropriate error message to the user.

6. Create a Navigation component
   - Implement links for navigating to the Map view, Search view, and Directions view.
   - Use React Router's `useHistory` hook to handle the navigation state.

7. Integrate all components
   - Integrate all the components together in the main App component.
   - Implement state management using React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks to handle the data flow between different components.

8. Testing
   - Use Jest and React Testing Library for writing unit tests for each component.
   - Test the integration of all components in the main App component.
   - Perform end-to-end testing using a tool like Cypress.

9. Deployment
   - Prepare the app for deployment by building a production version of the app using `npm run build`.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
   - Deploy the app to a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel.

10. Maintenance and Updates
    - Regularly update the application's dependencies to their latest versions.
    - Monitor the application's performance using tools like Google Analytics or New Relic.
    - Fix any bugs or issues that arise.
