Create a web design for a luxury car selling website that embodies the pinnacle of luxury and exclusivity for a discerning clientele. The design should incorporate a color palette of deep burgundy, sleek black, and metallic gold, and prominently feature a full-width hero image of a flagship luxury car model, with visual cues suggesting parallax scrolling. The homepage should be enhanced with clearly interactive car galleries, including detailed specifications, 360-degree views, and a visually intuitive car configurator for real-time customization. The user interface must be clean, with refined typography and subtle animations that underscore the brand's elite status. Security features for customer transactions should be visually prominent, and high-quality video content that tells the brand's story should be seamlessly integrated. Prominent CTA buttons for scheduling test drives and requesting quotes are essential, and the VIP section, brand history, and limited edition models should be distinct and highlighted. The design must be demonstrably responsive and accessible, ensuring a premium user experience on various devices.
