Create a visually stunning and realistic web design that embodies the exhilarating experience of skiing in Canada's majestic snow-capped mountains. The design should incorporate high-resolution, authentic images of Canada's most picturesque snowy landscapes and ski resorts, with interactive elements like a virtual tour of the top ski destinations, real user reviews, and professional recommendations for ski activities. The layout must be intuitive, with clearly labeled navigation to sections such as 'Best Time to Ski', 'Local Tours', 'Local Attractions', 'Travel Tips', and a prominently displayed booking system for ski resorts and rentals. The design should be responsive for seamless viewing on all devices, and the overall aesthetic should convey the adventure and beauty of a skiing holiday in Canada, with all text in clear, correct English (or bilingual if applicable) to cater to a wide audience.
