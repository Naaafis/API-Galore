Create a music listening web interface that mirrors the simplicity and user-friendliness of Spotify's design, with a focus on a monochromatic or dual-tone color palette for a relaxing visual experience. The interface should prioritize whitespace, sporting a clean and modern style, with well-defined sections for exploring music, viewing the current track, and handling playlists. Icons and controls should be minimalistic, consistent in size, and instantly recognizable to enable an effortless music listening journey. Simplify the central play button even further to embody the minimalistic approach of the design and ensure all text and icons are of a uniform size for a more unified appearance. Exclude any ornamental details and superfluous visual elements to maintain a polished and uncluttered interface.
